It also allows them to edit book descriptions and ratings, and delete bookmarks they do not like.
This app uses the bookmark API


As a user:

-(completed) All bookmarks in the list default to a "condensed" view showing only title and rating
I can click on a bookmark to display the "detailed" view

-(completed) Detailed view expands to additionally display description and a "Visit Site" link

-(completed) I can remove bookmarks from my bookmark list

-(completed) I receive appropriate feedback when I cannot submit a bookmark
